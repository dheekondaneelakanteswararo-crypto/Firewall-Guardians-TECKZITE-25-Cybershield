# Firewall Guardians 
Designed a phishing & scam email message detector using Artificial Intelligence to provide a risk level score (SAFE/ WARNING/ DANGER) based on sender information, email content, and links. Project is a simulation assignment for TeckZite 2k25 (S5) for a Cybersecurity course.

Problem Statement

A simulation-based system for Cybersecurity & Digital Safety should be developed for detecting spurious accounts and phishing attacks, for scanning and evaluating scam emails, for assigning a risk score, for generation of warning alerts, and for incident priority in security aspects for users.

Voilà, here's a nice "key features" block you can drop right into your GitHub README to showcase your Cyber Shield app:

#### ???? Key Features
- Real-time phishing and scam message detection via a simple web interface.
- Multi-factor risk scoring (sender and content patterns, links) - SAFE/WARNING / DANGER markings.==================== References: 
  
- Simulation based, using dummy/synthetic data, fully within the ambit of the hackathon rules (i.e., no actual money or personal data).[2]

- Lightweight web application based on Base44 capable of being deployed for secure and browser-based use for cybersecurity purposes.

Here’s a Tech Stack section you can include in your GitHub profile:
